# Extra Tests

This folder contains extra tests & metadata that is only intended to be used by Nebula Logger's pipeline within GitHub. If you are deploying Nebula Logger to your org (instead of using the unlocked or managed packages), then you do _not_ want to try to deploy this folder to your org - it can cause issues in your org and/or result in deployment errors.
