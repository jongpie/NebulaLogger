This folder contains metadata that is being appended to metadata that is owned by the core Logger package:

- New fields are added to the `Log__c` object
- New list views are added to the `Log__c` object

The folder structure mimics the same structure used by the core package (e.g., both directories have the structure `core/main/log-management`. This makes it easier for orgs that prefer to deploy the unpackaged metadata (instead of using the unlocked package) to combine the folders together, if desired.
