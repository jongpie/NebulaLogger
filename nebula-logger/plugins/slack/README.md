## What's Included

This plugin includes some add-on metadata for Nebula Logger to support the Slack integration

1. Apex class `SlackLoggerPlugin` and corresponding tests in `SlackLoggerPlugin_Tests`
2. Plugin configuration details stored in Logger's CMDT objects `LoggerPlugin__mdt` and `LoggerParameter__mdt`
3. Custom fields `Log__c.SendSlackNotification__c` and `Log__c.SlackNotificationDate__c`
4. Field-level security (FLS) via a new permission set `LoggerSlackPluginAdmin` to provide access to the custom Slack fields
5. Two custom list views for the `Log__c` object to see any `Log__c` records that have, or should be, sent to Slack
6. Remote site setting for Slack's API

## Installation Steps

In order to use the Slack plugin, there are some configuration changes needed in both Slack and Salesforce

### Slack setup

Within Slack, you'll need to setup incoming webhooks to allow the Logger Slack plugin to create messages. The high-level steps are:

1. Create a new app in your Slack workspace (or use an existing app, if you prefer)
2. Create a new incoming webhook for your app, and copy the webhook URL. This will be used in Salesforce (see below steps)

Check out [Slack's webhooks documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for more details on how to setup incoming webhooks.

### Salesforce setup

1. Ensure that you have the unlocked package version of Nebula Logger installed in your org
2. Install the unlocked package for the Slack plugin
3. Go to Setup --> Custom Metadata Types --> Logger Parameters. There are 2 parameters to configure (shown in screenshot below)
    - Parameter 'Slack Endpoint' - You can configure this webhook in 1 of 2 ways:
        - Easier but less secure: Paste the Slack webhook URL into the `Value__c` field and save the Plugin Parameter record.
        - More secure: Create a new Named Credential, using the webhook URL as the endpoint. Within the Parameter 'Slack Endpoint', enter `callout:<your named credential>` into the `Value__c` field and save the Plugin Parameter record
    - Parameter 'Slack Notification Logging Level' - Set the desired logging level value that should trigger a Slack notification to be sent the Logger Plugin Parameter 'Slack Notification Logging Level`. It controls which logging level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, FINE, FINER, or FINEST) will trigger the Slack notifications to be sent.

The Slack integration should now be setup & working - any new logs that meet the specified notification logging level (step 6 above) will send a Slack notification.
