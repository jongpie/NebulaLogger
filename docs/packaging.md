# Release Managed and Unlocked Packages

CumulusCI makes it easy to build first- and second-generation managed
packages, as well as unlocked packages. While the overall workflows for
all types of packages are quite similar, there are key differences
between them. The chapters below explore all three packaging options.

New projects should, absent any other considerations, generally choose
to use second-generation managed packages or unlocked packages. Learn
more about second-generation packaging and its advantages in the
